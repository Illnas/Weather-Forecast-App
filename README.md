<h1>Weather Forecast App</h1>

In days when I was waiting for replies to my applications, I decided to actually start programming (again).

So, in a search for an idea what to do, I saw name of the livestream that was happening in Scrimba discord, 
and I decided to do weather forecast app. 

It was not that hard a project to do, it took me five days to finish it. And, the part where I was stuck the most,
was design (again)! Still, it was fun project, although I feel bad that it is "small" in amount of features,
but API that I was using, had free option, which meant less data, which meant less features. Still, I did
project.

There is something that is bothering me, and that is security part of this project. Apparently, my API key,
from rapidAPI is exposed, and even if I use .env file, it could still be seen in console in the browser,
so now I am in a search for a way to hide that api key completely! I did tutorial on Node.js, which I will do 
few projects with, hope it will help a lot in this search.

Anyway, onwards to new projects!!!
